# User Bookings

## IMPORTANT:
We've started over in Jupyter Notebook. I'm trying to implement Gradient Boosting with xGBoost
currently and will update the documentation when there's a new working model up.

A prediction model for predicting where a user will book their first AirBnB location.

## Getting Started

To get this project working on your local machine you should have [https://www.python.org/downloads/](Python3) and [https://www.tensorflow.org/install/](Tensorflow).

Download the data from [https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings/data](Kaggle)

Create a directory in the folder named "app" and call it "data"

Then place all the data from Kaggle into that folder.
